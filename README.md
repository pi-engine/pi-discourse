pi-discourse
============

PHP clone of https://github.com/discourse/discourse

In `template/`, folder `discourse/` is a theme of pi-discourse, it shouldn't be here but I put it here for version control.

Before using pi-discour module, user should cut `usr/module/discourse/template/discourse/` to `theme/discourse` and install discourse theme(install, not use).
